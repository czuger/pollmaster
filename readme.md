Here is a quick list of features:

- Create a poll to know who is want to play what game
- Refresh your poll for the next week

- Remove a poll
- Show all polls

## Getting Started

Users with the server permission "Manage Server" will have all rights from the start, meaning you can get started with pm!new right away!

To grant users without "Manage Server" poll creation access to the bot, create and distribute the role *polladmin* or *polluser*. If you already have roles for these rights you can tell the bot by typing *pm!adminrole <your role>* and *pm!userrole <your role>*.
